	// What is a Identifier in Java :- Any name which is used to identify a datatype, method name, class name etc is called Identifier in Java.
	// Rules for Defining/Declaring Identifiers are 
			// 1)  a to z , A to Z , 0 to 9 , $ and underscore, if we use any other characters apart from these we get compile time error.
			// 2) They cannot start with digits like 123IdentifierName,
			// 3) They are case sensitive since java language itself is treated as case sensitive language.
