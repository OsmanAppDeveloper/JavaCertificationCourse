//What is a Data Type :- Before understanding what is data type, first we should know what is a variable, a variable is a reserved space in memory,
// so when you create a variable(that means you a creating a reserved space in memory for your program), now in java when you create a variable, you can't just create it,
// you need to specify its data type, like to which group of data it belong, since you have to explicitly define the Data type at the declaring a variable for this reason java is called strictly/strongly type language.
