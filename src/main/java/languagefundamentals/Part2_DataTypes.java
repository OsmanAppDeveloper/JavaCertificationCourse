//What is a Data Type :- Before understanding what is data type, first we should know what is a variable, a variable is a reserved space in memory,
// so when you create a variable(that means you a creating a reserved space in memory for your program), now in java when you create a variable, you can't just create it,
// you need to specify its data type, like to which group of data it belong, since you have to explicitly define the Data type at the declaring a variable for this reason java is called strictly/strongly type language. 
// There are two categories of Data Types :- 1) Primitive  2) Non Primitive
// There are 8 Primitive Data Type, again this 8 types can be divided into two groups which are Numeric and Non Numeric.
// Numeric Types :- Again we have 2 groups in Numberic Types Integral Types and Floating Point Data Types
// Integral Types :- byte , short , int , long.
// floating Type :- double, long.
// Non Numeric :- Char, boolean.
